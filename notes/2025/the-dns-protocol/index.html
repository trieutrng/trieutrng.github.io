  <meta property="og:description" content="As an engineer in computer industry, everyone should be familiar with the DNS, how a domain is resolved into IP eventually. Yet not everyone understands how the protocol is defined and how the packet is contructed as well. Thus, this post will go through the DNS packet definition and provide an actual implemetation eventually.
